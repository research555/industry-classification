They have also [recently](http://www.joost.com/forums/p/2007/08/widget-api/) developed a new Widget API open to third parties to make their own Joost widgets. 

 Unlike many online video platforms, joost does require a download and cannot play video directly from users' browsers.   joost offers a desktop client that allows the user to watch on-demand TV over the internet. In addition, Joost enhances the TV experience by offering interactive tools. For example, users will be able to chat with friends while watching a show. The channels will also have interactive displays where users can discover behind-the-scene content.

 Joost's peer-to-peer technology also lowers the cost of channel owners by reducing the amount of data the servers must stream out. joost only serves some selected users, while the rest of the data is distributed from user to user.

Our  focus is treatment of nosocomial infections, in particular complicated urinary tract infections and hospital or ventilator acquired pneumonia caused by multi drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria. 

 Complicated urinary tract infections are caused by predominantly Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Escherichia coli. E. coli is also a frequent cause of many other common bacterial infections such as  cholecystitis, bacteremia, cholangitis and traveler’s diarrhea, as well as other clinical infections such as neonatal meningitis and pneumonia. Most Infections caused by Escherichia coli are relative easy to cure, however, hospital adapted strains of Escherichia coli are often multi-resistant and are able to cause life threatening infections.

 Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator acquired pnemonia (VAP) are also indications dominated by Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa has become an important cause of infection, especially in patients with compromised host defense mechanisms. It is the most common pathogen isolated from patients who have been hospitalized longer than 1 week and it is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, UTIs, and bacteremia. Infections caused by Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are complicated since many Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains are multi drug resistant.

 Infections caused by Acinetobacter are rare and most strains found outside hospitals are sensitive to antibiotics. While Acinetobacter poses few risks to healthy individuals, a few species, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, can cause serious infections – mainly in very ill trauma and hospitalized patients increasing the post trauma mortality as seen in wounded soldiers in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The most common Acinetobacter infections include pneumonia, bacteraemia, wound infections, and urinary tract infections. ‘Hospital-adapted’ strains of Acinetobacter are often resistant to antibiotics and are increasingly difficult to treat. Adenium Biotech strives to find a novel treatment for multi-resistant Acinetobacter.

 Arenicin is a non haemolytic and non cytotoxic 21 amino acids antimicrobial peptide isolated from the lugworm. Arenicin has a strong and selective efficacy against Gram negative bacteria as well as a broad therapeutic window. Ten Arenicin variants were selected and subjected to a ranking program consisting of toxicology as well as in vitro and in vivo efficacy profiling. The three highest ranking Arenicin variants were selected in December 2013 for final lead optimization and selection of an Arenicin lead product candidate early in the fourth quarter 2013.

 The bullion is kept in approved vaults within the London Good Delivery system.   Good delivery bullion bars are produced by London Bullion Market Association [LBMA] approved refiners, have a known history and can be easily re-sold.   Most of the world's professional gold dealing happens within the LBMA good delivery rules.   BullionVault is a full member of the LBMA.

 Unlike most gold investment products, BullionVault's clients own their gold directly as property in their own name within the jurisdiction the gold is stored.   Clients can chose to store their gold in Zurich, London, New York or Singapore.

 An internal market allows clients can trade their holdings with each other in units as small as a single gram.   Clients can choose to place large orders [800oz] through the London professional markets.   BullionVault itself also runs trading bots to ensure liquidity, quoting two-way prices on its exchange 24/7.

In June 2010, the gold industry's key market-development body the World Gold Council joined with the internet and technology fund Augmentum Capital, which is backed by the London-listed Rothschild Investment Trust, in making an $18.8 million (GB £12.5m) investment in the business.   This makes BullionVault rare as a disruptive start-up that has been willingly embraced by an established industry.

 Their exchange's technology stack runs almost entirely on open-source components.   CTO Kris Jenkins says, ""I couldn't imagine trying to build a company like BullionVault using proprietary software. I've seen startups die while they were still negotiating support contracts. Often when they could have picked an open solution so reliable it would never need support. ""

 Kepler has no direct economic competitors in providing access to tidal stream resource where first generation turbines are not economic, and represents the first disruptive technology to positively impact on the economics of power production from this predictable source of sustainable energy. This is because the Kepler turbine is very different to all others on the market - it is larger, scaleable, intrinsically more powerful and patented.

 Our world-unique position-based scanning technology enables consumers to receive a deposit value in their mobile phone when recycling their packaging at pinpointed places. Our solution can be connected to all sorts of packaging – everything from plastic bags to take-away mugs to products. There is no longer any need to invest in expensive reverse vending machines – instead, consumers are able to recycle at already existing recycling stations or at othe pinpointed locations selected by connected consumer brands.

 centivizing recycling with financial means is a proven way to increase recycling rates. Bower® is a mobile app that enables consumer brands to put a deposit value on their packaging – either in the form of money or points. By doing so, they take a

greater responsibility for their packaging and, at the same time, get a direct relationship to their end-consumers through the app. To create a deposit system is simpler than it sounds. There is already a habitual behavior to visit deposit stations.

22985,Branäsgruppen,resort operator,"n the early 1960s, ideas were raised on a ski slope in Branäs. The then Finnskoga-Dalby municipality received a promise from Prime Minister Tage Erlander of a million SEK in support. This provided that any person in charge would take care of the project. At that time, however, no one was willing to be responsible for the construction of a ski slope in Branäs.

 It was only in the mid-1980s that the project got a real boost. LO-Värmland took over the Branä project, and together with HSB Värmland and the county council in Värmland managed to finance. In July 1987, the message was given that the Branä project would receive state aid. In 1988 the spade was put into the ground and the inauguration of the plant was made by King Carl XVI Gustaf in December of the same year.

 Over 500 million kronor were invested in the first few years, after which it became more difficult as costs went off and bankruptcy was close. In 1992 an agreement was made with creditors and the debts were written down by 75%. HSB Sweden took over the plant and operated it until 1999. After that, the current owners took over Branäs Fritidscenter AB and since 2004 belonged to Kungsberg's ski resort in the Branä Group. The Group also includes Vallåsen Ski Resort, Ulricehamn Ski Center, Ånnaboda, Storstenshöjden and Tolvmannabacken.",Travel,0.414,Telecoms,0.237,Sharing Economy,0.214,Circular Economy,0.211,Biodiversity,0.195

Fit clients embrace the local processing and offline capabilities of Thick Clients while providing tooling normally associated with thin-client web applications. Fit Clients can leverage the processing power and disc space of the client machine, but they can also offer more restrictive and secure environments than client/server platforms. 

 Using Curl, developers can implement a new class of complex, business-critical, Web-based applications that cannot easily be developed with Ajax or other smart client technologies. Curl has always provided fit client capabilities and, with a new version announced this month called Nitro, they are available more easily than ever on the desktop.

Such a profile is typically called a biomarker and for official approval, it must be demonstrated successfully on a large population.

The members of the management team have previously been involved with ten successful start-up companies. The company's employees are a tight knit team who have extensive backgrounds of working together at previous companies and projects.

 Additionally, most of the people in the company have their roots deep in the ""demo scene"" computer culture. The demo scene started in the 80s on the early home computers such as Commodore 64 and Amiga. It is here where low-level assembly programming and optimization was taken into a whole new level and seemingly impossible visual effects were created on super-limited hardware.

 Fathammer's core strengths include the thorough know-how of real-time 3D graphics technologies, optimizing for the limited hardware configurations of mobile devices and the development of high quality games. Combining this with seasoned project management, innovative product development and creative design, Fathammer can satisfy the specific needs of its customers in an effective way.

 Fathammer's engineering and development operations are based in Helsinki, Finland. Fathammer also has an office in San Jose, California, which coordinates the company's sales and marketing activities.
