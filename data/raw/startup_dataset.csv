1172,alcemy,"Concrete is the most widely used building material on our planet. The only thing mankind uses more of is water. With a wave of urban development coming in the next few decades, concrete is also a rapidly growing trillion-dollar market. However, cement and concrete production is responsible for 8% of the global CO2 emissions, making its growth a big cause for concern.

Low-carbon concrete exists - but until now it has been too sophisticated to be produced reliably and on a large scale. It contains very little burnt limestone - responsible for the strength of concrete and CO2 emissions. This makes low-carbon concrete vulnerable to fluctuations in raw materials and operating conditions and thus difficult to produce with reliable quality. Adding to the challenge: the final quality of concrete can only be measured weeks AFTER it has been processed on the construction site - far too late to be corrected. This is why our world is still built on more robust, high-carbon concrete. 

Using alcemy's software, cement and concrete producers receive precise quality predictions already during production. Based on these prediction models, our AI identifies which production parameters need to be adjusted to mitigate the impact of fluctuations. Thus, the quality of cement and concrete can be optimized BEFORE delivery ñ for the first time in history.

The result is significantly more consistent product quality, allowing producers to safely replace burnt limestone with less expensive, low-carbon materials found in nature. In this way, they can also avoid payments for CO2 emission certificates in the EU. 

Saving costs, bringing production processes up to speed for 21st century concrete recipes, and saving half of Europeís CO2 emissions goes hand in hand at alcemy. Join us on our journey to make low-carbon concrete a reality!"

2107,Catapillr,"We are a parent-run technology company, offering the Childcare Cash Advance Scheme (C-CAS) to working parents or to employers as a voluntary employee benefit. 

Why use C-CAS? 

Children are great, no question but early years and school-age childcare is expensive.  The C-CAS scheme helps to make childcare more affordable and easier to manage.
 
What exactly is C-CAS?

The scheme is essentially an online account, mobile app and marketplace.  Employers can support their employees by providing an interest-free 12-month loan, which is paid in to their online account, to then be used specifically for childcare costs.

Can everyone use C-CAS? 

Yes.  Whilst the scheme has been developed as a voluntary employee benefit, you can still use the scheme, even if your employer doesnít offer C-CAS as a benefit.

How long does the loan last? 

The interest-free loan is to be repaid over a maximum of 12 months, but the money does not need to be used within the year, which means you can build up a balance to pay for all those unexpected childcare costs.

What can I use the loan for? 

The scheme can be used with Ofsted (or equivalent) registered childcare providers or companies/organisations who provide childcare activities, such as after-school & holiday clubs, sports & activity clubs, as well as tutors, which gives parents significant flexibility. 

How easy is it to use?

From the minute the loan-sum lands in your account, you will be able to choose, book and pay for all of your childcare services from the very same digital portal.  We have endeavoured to put the emphasis on simplicity; ëOne Payment. One Portal. One Solutioní.


How can I find out further information about C-CAS?

6843,Centauri-Therapeutics,"Centauri Therapeutics is a UK-based biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel molecules targeting life threatening diseases. 

The Alphamer technology is based on ""programmable immunity"" in which chemically synthesised molecules redirect naturally occurring antibodies to selected pathogens to fight the infection. The molecules have two distinct parts: one end binds a cell-surface target on the pathogen using an aptamer whereas the other end presents specific epitopes that attach to the circulating antibodies. It has been demonstrated that Alphamers have the potential to redirect pre-existing antibodies to bacteria in a specific manner and trigger an immediate antibacterial immune response, so clearing the infection. 

Centauri Therapeuticsí strategy is to redirect naturally occurring antibodies to target disease. Centauri Therapeutics' unique Chemistry Platform provides a flexible scaffold to enable the synthesis of specific Alphamers. These are bifunctional molecules which present a selective cell binding moiety as well as an epitope that recruits pre-existing antibodies, resulting in cell killing. 

Centauri Therapeutics believes their technology is widely applicable in the treatment of life threatening infectious diseases. Companies with an interest in accessing Centauriís Alphamer technology or with an interest in one of their current projects, are warmly encouraged to contact them to discuss partnering opportunities. 

In order to drive success in the important area of immuno-oncology, Centauri Therapeutics has established a joint venture, Avvinity Therapeutics, with Horizon Discovery in March 2016. Avvinity combines Centauriís Alphamer Technology with the gene editing and oncology expertise of Horizon.

The unique CricViz computer model enables the prediction of match outcome, the interpretation of team and player performance and the anticipation of what is likely to happen next; cricket intelligence at the next level.

WinViz probabilities are generated by CricVizís unique computer model of Test cricket. This utilises a database of the last 500 Test matches played, using past and current data to estimate the probability of future events.

The model uses the current state of the match, each playerís career history and characteristics of the venue and host country to simulate the remainder of the match. The simulations are run thousands of times, with the number of results that produce each match outcome converted into probabilities ñ if 4,000 out of 10,000 iterations result in a team winning, then that team has a 40% probability of winning.

The PredictViz function outlines the most likely course the match will follow from its current position. The unique CricViz model of past and current data simulates the remainder of the game thousands of times, with the average predicted outcome for each team plotted across the gameís remaining timeline.

The likeliest score and end point of each innings is predicted using the current state of the match, each playerís career history and characteristics of the venue and host country.

PlayViz breaks down each teamís performance into its three basic aspects ñ batting, bowling and fielding. Each of those areas is given a positive or negative score in runs, measuring the performance of that team against that of an average Test team in the conditions present at that time.

Team performances are compared to those of an average Test team, with adjustments taken into account for the pitch and opposition strength. The comprehensive historical database predicts the average performance of batsmen and bowlers in the position and role they are playing in. The PlayViz function measures performance relative to averages that take into account extra variables.

Each teamís fielding performance is measured on the direct impact it has had on the score. Runs saved and missed are totalled for each player, with a dropped catch measured at the value of the wicket that was missed according to the model of projected scores. Fielding scores are adjusted by a system that rates the difficulty of a piece of fielding.

BatViz gives a measure of how difficult batting has been in the last 30 minutes of play. It shows how hard it is for the batsmen to survive and score.

The ball tracking data from every ball bowled in the match is compared to a database of over 300,000 Test deliveries. The balls in this database that are the most similar to the delivery being measured are evaluated in terms of wickets taken and runs conceded, with a game aggregate built to provide a metric of current batting difficulty at that time."

1) Funds in the currency to be sold are sent by the customer to the corresponding CurrencyFair bank account.  When received by CurrencyFair, they are credited to the users individual CurrencyFair account and made available for exchanging.
2) Available funds in a users account can at any time be exchanged by the user into another currency using the corresponding marketplace (for example GBP to EUR).
3) Funds received from marketplace exchanges are available to be sent out to a bank account as instructed online by the customer.

Each currency exchange marketplace (for example GBP to EUR) gives the customer a choice: exchange immediately at the best rate available (usually no worse than 0.5% from the interbank rate, and sometimes better than the interbank rate), or place an order at a better exchange rate and wait to be matched off by another customer exchanging on the opposite market (for example EUR to GBP).  Funds that are placed unmatched on the marketplace are aggregated by rate, and may be matched in part or in full at any time.  Unmatched orders can be cancelled or amended at any time.  All exchanges are anonymous - the customer only deals with CurrencyFair.

CurrencyFair is regulated by the Irish Financial Regulator as an Authorised Payments Institution under the European Payment Services Regulations 2009.  Authorised Payment Institutions (as opposed to Small Payments Institutions) are required to provide safeguards around client funds during the exchange and transfer process.

Arhalofenate is a novel oral small molecule being developed to treat the approximately 1 million gout patients that flare three or more times per year. Gout flares are painful inflammatory episodes caused by crystals of monosodium urate (MSU) that result from excess serum uric acid (sUA). In three Phase 2 studies in gout patients arhalofenate was shown to reduce the incidence and duration of flares while simultaneously lowering sUA. If confirmed in additional clinical studies, arhalofenateís dual acting profile would be unique since all other urate lowering therapies paradoxically increase flares as they lower sUA over the first 6 to 12 months of treatment. Increased flares lead many patients to stop or avoid treatment leading to progression of disease with pain and suffering, erosion of joint structure and functionality, lost time from work, and increased healthcare costs."

7597,Cynata,"Cynata Therapeutics Limited is an Australian stem cell and regenerative medicine company that is developing a therapeutic stem cell platform technology, Cymerusô, using discoveries made at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM). UWM is a world-renowned leader in stem cell research, in particular for the work by Professor James Thomson's group, which included the first successful isolation of human embryonic stem cells in 1998, and the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human adult cells in 2007. Professor Igor Slukvin, a co-founder of Cynata, was also a member of the team that conducted UWM's pioneering iPSC research.

Cynata's Cymerusô platform stem cell technology is based upon extremely important and versatile stem cells known as mesenchymoangioblasts (MCAs). MCAs are a precursor of mesenchymal stem (or stromal) cells (MSCs) which are at the forefront of a new generation of treatments being investigated for such devastating diseases as osteoarthritis, Crohnís disease and heart disease. Cynataís proprietary technology utilizes iPSCs originating from an adult donor as the starting material for generating MCAs and in turn for manufacturing the MSC therapeutic product.

Cynata will use the proprietary Cymerusô technology to address a critical shortcoming in existing methods of production of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for therapeutic use, which is the ability to achieve economic manufacture at commercial scale. This opens up a wide range of therapeutic and manufacturing possibilities for the Company.

The Cymerusô technology has several characteristics which makes it ideal for the development of cell-based therapeutics. Most critically, the Cymerusô manufacturing process ensures that cells for therapeutic use can be produced in virtually limitless quantities. This means that Cynata will not have to constantly seek out fresh stem cell donors to fuel its manufacturing demands. This has the potential to create a new standard in the emergent arena of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapeutics and provides Cynata with both a unique differentiator and an important competitive position."

A consequence of diabetic retinopathy, DMO, is swelling in an area of the retina called the macula and wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD), which is the leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 and older.  The Company is founded on scientific excellence with strong links to Professor David Bates and his lab at Nottingham University specializing in the biology and biochemical pathways of VEGF splice variants.

Exonate have developed small molecules that inhibit production of pro-angiogenic VEGF through selective inhibition of serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated VEGF splicing.  These inhibitors have already demonstrated superior efficacy as topical agents in preclinical models of wet AMD.  Through a Wellcome Trust funded project, Exonate has completed an optimization programme and has nominated a pre-clinical candidate drug with optimal characteristics.

During the second quarter of 2020 regulatory toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have taken place. This is to support the successful application to the regulatory authorities for clinical evaluation.  

Exonate is led by an experienced, international management team that has previously worked together with cross-disciplinary experience in medicine and drug development, as well as successful fundraising for early stage companies.

About Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO)*:
DMO is the build-up of fluid (Oedema) in a region of the retina called the macula. The macula is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. DMO is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy. About half of all people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DMO and although it is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, DMO can happen at any stage of the disease.

About wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD):
Today, wet AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 years or older and affects more than 30 million patients worldwide, over 200,000 of those in the UK alone. If untreated patients are likely to lose sight in the affected eye within 24 months of disease onset.

The main currently available treatment options for DMO and wet AMD are:
ï	anti-VEGF antibody drugs ñ to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Unlike small molecule drugs or eye drops these treatments must be injected into the eye once every 1 or 2 months. Resistance can develop to these drugs causing the disease to progress anew.
ï	Laser surgery ñ to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This type of surgery is only suitable if blood vessel damage is not too extensive and if the abnormal blood vessels aren't close to the fovea, as performing surgery close to this part of the eye can cause permanent vision loss.
ï	With DMO, Corticosteroids either injected or implanted into the eye, may be used alone or in combination with other drugs or laser surgery to treat DMO.

6896,Green-Plug,"Green Plug brings about a much needed revolution in the way we power electronic products. Today, dozens of consumer electronics (CE products) require external power adapters and battery chargers. Unfortunately, there is no common interface that will provide for interoperability and reusability, convenience, savings and the reduction of unnecessary components that wind up as eWaste because power adapters are normally thrown away when they are in perfect working condition. That's not sustainable. That's poor economics. And, Green Plug has changed this for the better.

Green Plug is the first developer of digital technology that enables real-time collaboration between electronic devices and their power sources. Billions of devices including laptops, printers, speakers, routers, modems, cell phones, entertainment devices, power tools, cameras and so many other portable electronic devices require a power source that converts between 90V and 254V wall power to device-specific DC power. That means that these devices require unique power converters, and that is very costly, is extremely inconvenient and contributes to wasted resources and pollution.

Greentalk(TM)-enabled intelligent power supplies, however, communicate with electronic devices and negotiate device power requirements for all devices connected to them. All cables and connectors are uniform; so, they work with any device! Being intelligent power sources, they eliminate wasted ""phantom power"" (power that is wasted when chargers are plugged in and either connected to devices that are fully charged or have no devices connected to them.) Greentalk provides an API for power monitoring and reporting applications as well as advanced control built upon 2-way communication."

Joost is a p2p on demand video player that offers professional (legal) programming much like on your television, but whenever you want.  The service is free, however, there are video advertisements interspersed between and during programs as well as small type or image ads on the sides of your screen.

With very heavy backing from media giants CBS and Viacom, Joost looks good to take on competitors [Bablegum](http://crunchbase.com/organization/bablegum) and [Microsoft LiveStation](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/06/first-look-at-livestation-not-much-to-report/).  Currently Joost has content deals with CNN, the NHL and Sony as well as their financiers CBS and Viacom (MTV, Comedy Central etc). They have also [recently](http://www.joost.com/forums/p/2007/08/widget-api/) developed a new Widget API open to third parties to make their own Joost widgets. 

Unlike many online video platforms, joost does require a download and cannot play video directly from users' browsers.  joost offers a desktop client that allows the user to watch on-demand TV over the internet. In addition, Joost enhances the TV experience by offering interactive tools. For example, users will be able to chat with friends while watching a show. The channels will also have interactive displays where users can discover behind-the-scene content.

Joost's peer-to-peer technology also lowers the cost of channel owners by reducing the amount of data the servers must stream out. joost only serves some selected users, while the rest of the data is distributed from user to user.  

Rumor has it that Joost is in talks with hardware manufacturers to [embed](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/15/embedded-joost-will-change-the-market/) its platform into TV set-top boxes. If the move were successful it could change the TV industry substantially.

7451,Mitoconix-Bio,"Mitoconix Bio is pioneering a disease-modifying strategy of improving mitochondrial functions for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Mitochondria generates ATP, the energy source for all cellular activities. Mitochondria are also involved in other essential cellular functions, including calcium sequestration, amino acid and lipid metabolism, keeping balanced redox potential and orchestrating programmed cell death. In neurons in particular, mitochondria are very dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission (division) and fusion. This process, called mitochondrial dynamics, is critical in maintaining healthy and functional mitochondria under both normal conditions and in response to stress and in ensuring having viable mitochondria along the axons and in the synaptic boutons. A defect in either fusion or fission limits mitochondrial motility, decreases energy production, increases oxidative stress and activates pro-apoptotic signaling thereby promoting cell dysfunction and death.

Mitoconixí lead drug is a first-in-class inhibitor of pathological mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction with demonstrated in vivo efficacy in animal models of Huntingtonís (HD) and Parkinsonís diseases (PD) and beneficial activity in patient-derived cells of HD, sporadic and genetic PD, and sporadic and genetic Alzheimerís disease (AD)."

9,Morphogen-IX,"MORPHOGEN-IX Limited is a drug discovery company founded in 2015 by Index Ventures to develop bone morphogenetic proteins as a novel therapy for the treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a severe and life-limiting disease that affects the blood vessels in the lungs, leading to heart failure, and leaves sufferers feeling breathless and exhausted. Current treatments mainly target symptoms and the prognosis remains poor. The only effective cure is transplantation of the lungs or heart and lungs, which has associated risks and complications.

Compromised bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR-II) signalling in endothelial cells plays a pivotal role in the pathobiology PAH, as identified from human genetic studies.

BMP9 and 10 represent circulating ligands that selectively bind and activate BMPR-II receptor complexes on endothelial cells. Administration of exogenous BMP9 has been shown to augment endothelial BMPR-II signalling and reverse PAH in several rodent models of disease.

The volume of mobile data traffic is exploding and 5G will have to fulfill a growing variety of performance requirements, ranging from extreme mobile broadband to low-latency automotive IoT. To accommodate such demands, enhanced flexibility in managing the infrastructure is needed. Network slicing allows operators to customize resources on a per-service basis, by virtually partitioning the physical infrastructure, thereby enabling new lucrative revenue streams. However, without deep intelligence into the traffic flowing over slices, and where it originates, it is impossible to effectively and efficiently monetize them. 

To address this need, our Microscope software uses AI to perform mobile traffic decomposition. Microscope identifies and quantifies the nature and source of individual streams (e.g. Netflix, Google cloud services, Facebook, etc; down to individual base station) from aggregate streams. This allows data to be collected in the cloud rather than from expensive location-based probes, and also works with encrypted data sources which are impossible to analyze with traditional approaches such as using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). 

Our technology tackles the challenges of decomposition through deep learning, due to its effectiveness in operating on large-scale mobile traffic in real-time, as demonstrated by our own research. Microscope is fast, cheap, encryption agnostic, scalable, and compatible with current NFV and open RAN initiatives"

3635,OakNorth,"In 2005, our co-founders, Rishi Khosla and Joel Perlman, were looking for a working capital facility to support their growing business, Copal Partners, a financial research firm theyíd founded three years previously.  
 
They approached numerous high-street banks and kept getting variations of the same response ñ ìthe computer says ëNoíî. Despite being a profitable business with strong cash flow and retained clients, none of the commercial banks were willing to lend to them. It was too small a ticket to offset the costs the bank would incur in doing a fundamental assessment of their business and structuring a finance facility for their needs. A few months later through one of their institutional clientís special situations desk, they managed to secure 100x the amount of debt for a dividend recap. So, an institutional division of a bank was able to support them, but the commercial lending part of the bank was not.  
 
This experience stuck with them.  
 
After theyíd scaled Copal Partners to a 3,000-employee business and sold it to Moodyís Corporation (NYSE: MCO) in 2014, they set out to address the funding gap they had experienced first-hand and empower the Missing Middle, through launching OakNorth.  
 
OakNorthís (ON) Credit Intelligence Suite transforms commercial lending by helping banks build deeper relationships with their clients, open new, more profitable opportunities, whilst delivering credit decisions up to ten times faster than traditional models, with lower risk and greater efficiency.

Built over five years by an engineering and credit science team of over 250 people, the ON Credit Intelligence Suite has propelled OakNorth Bank in the UK into the top 1% of banks in developed markets in terms of RORE and efficiency, enabling it to profitably manage a multi-billion-dollar commercial lending portfolio - benefits that banks across the world can now realize.

9475,QV-Bioelectronics,"QV Bioelectronics is striving to deliver longer, better quality lives to brain tumour patients through their first of its kind electric field therapy implant, GRACE. 

GRACE has been designed alongside some of the leading neurosurgeons in the UK, with the aim of extending patient life expectancy without impacting patient quality of life. For patients with the most common primary brain tumour, glioblastoma, there has been a severe lack of new, effective treatments for decades, with only a handful of approved options. Because of this, glioblastoma has some of the worst outcomes of any cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of <5.  Co-founder and academic neurosurgeon Dr Richard Fu recognised this and was frustrated not only by the lack of treatments available for patients but also by major design flaws in newer electric field therapy approaches. Working together with Dr Chris Bullock, a biomedical engineer who had been carrying out research at Manchester's world-class materials research centres, they formed an elegant solution designed to optimise patient life-expectancy and quality of life. 

QV Bioelectronics was founded to their solution GRACE, to patients. Since then, their ground-breaking materials science research has received nearly $1M in financial awards from several UK institutions, including Innovate UK and the National Institute for Health Research in the UK, as well as over $1M in equity funding from international life science seed investors SOSV, and renowned life-science investors in Consilience & Catapult Ventures.

1779,Readl,"If Amazon closes tomorrow, you will lose all your Kindle books. That's our motto. We are developing a framework to reshape the digital publishing sector. 

On one hand, writers and publishers are suffering in digital something that did not happen in the real world (or was very difficult and costly), and that is counterfeit copies of digital books. Since the ebook format appeared, it has been relatively easy to copy and distribute the book without the consent of the owners of the intellectual property. The situation improved a little with the appearance of Amazon and its Kindle ebook, since users, for ease of use, find it more convenient to buy books to create a library and store them in the cloud. But this leads to abuse in the business model, since Amazon commissions between 20-30% of the price of the book, and the same publishers often make abusive contracts to the artist, in this case, the writer. We are already seeing this on other platforms such as Spotify, where artists, who feel exploited, have no alternatives to a fair model. In addition, when users pay for these digital works, they do not usually have a copy of it in their library as was the case in the real world, they pay for access to the content, but not for the content.

Thanks to the emergence of Blockchain, the next step to be taken in this sector is to re-empower writers and publishers, and also the user, allowing them to create and buy unique digital books, and that only they own, with a fair royalty model for the creator of the work, and provide new functionalities to the reader to enrich the experience of reading a book, an act that we have been doing for more than 2000 years...let's continue its evolution."
